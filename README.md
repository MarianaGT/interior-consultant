This website mock-up of an Interior Consultant is built with a responsive grid system that allows the rescaling of text and images to different device screen sizes.
Some of the technicalities include the use of z-indexes to address the hierarchy of elements in the viewport; additionally, the primary and secondary colors are defined with variables to improve code maintainability.
